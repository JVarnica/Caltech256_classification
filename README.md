# Caltech256_classification

 - Which pre-trained model performs best on the caltech256.
 - What architecture is best to use as a feature extractor.

To answer these questions the following experiments are done:

1.  Linear probing to evaluate the feature extraction captabilities of models.
2.  Simple fine-tuning of models for a baseline metric.
3.  Advanced fine-tuning of best models to see max performances.
